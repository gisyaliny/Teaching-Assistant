# R Markdown Formatting

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Please systematically explore this link and its sub-links.

Direct help on R Markdown's key formatting commands is directly available from RStudio's online help `Help > Markdown Quick Reference`. An extended overview is available from the  [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).

## Including R Code and Output
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. The keyboard short cut to insert a code chunk template is __Cntr-Alt-I__. You can embed a _display style_ R code chunk like this:

```{r mtcars}
summary(mtcars)
```
Another option is to include _inline code_ that performs calculations within the text and shows its results. For instance, the number of observations in the `cars` data-frame is `r nrow(cars)`.

## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r milage, echo=FALSE}
plot(mpg~wt, data=mtcars, main=params$title)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. Note the use of the parameter `params$title` as substitute for the plot title.

## Including References
Markdown examples in R package vignettes can be found in the package `DallasTracts`, which can be downloaded from the [ThinkR website](http://thinkr.spatialfiltering.com/Downloads/DallasTracts_0.2.2.tar.gz) and installed with the R command
```{r DallasTractInstall, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("http://thinkr.spatialfiltering.com/Downloads/DallasTracts_0.2.2.tar.gz", repos=NULL)
```
The first vignette (@Tief2019a) provides an example to evaluate the potential presences of food deserts in Dallas County and the second vignette (@Tief2019b) performs a hierarchical cluster analysis under a spatial contiguity constraint to identify homogeneous market areas in Dallas County.

Note that the references to both vignettes are stored in the document `Lecture01.bib`. These can be elegantly managed with the open source bibliography reference manager __JabRef__ (See <https://www.jabref.org/>).

The list of references is automatically generated at the end of the Markdown document. Therefore, the document should end with as simple section heading `# References`.

## Including Equations
Equations can be incorporated into the Markdown document by using $\LaTeX$ style syntax. A basic overview on how to typeset equations with $\LaTeX$ is available in its [cheatsheet](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/) An inline equation is framed by a pair of dollar-signs. For example the _sample_ arithmetic mean is $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$. 

In contrast, a display equation is centered on its individual line within a paragraph. It is framed by a pair of double dollar-signs. For example the _population_ variance is defined by: $$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}{n-1}$$
