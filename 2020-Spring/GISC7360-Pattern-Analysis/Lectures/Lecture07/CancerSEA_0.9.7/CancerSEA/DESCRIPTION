    Migration". 
    The following is included in the library CancerSEA: 
    [a] geographic polygon files to map the 508 SEAs including AK and HI;
    [b] cancer data for the 508 SEAs for the periods 1950-69 and 1970-94,

    [d] a 508 by 508 SEA origin-destination migration matrix for the accounting 
        period 1965-70; 
    [e] scripts used in the discussion paper; and
